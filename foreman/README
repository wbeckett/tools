update_puppet_git_environment.sh

This is a demo on a script that manages Puppet environments
that are maintained in GIT repos. The idea is you commit your changes
to an environment, which this script will checkout into PREP. Once this has
been tested, this script can update this to the DEV environment, and so on.

pull_foreman_hosts_for_awx.py

than the default method and useful when I need a quick turnaround
