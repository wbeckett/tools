check_postgres_master.sh

This is an example of how HAproxy can check which Postgres DB server is the master
and only direct traffic towards that server. This could be used in along with
keepalived and a floating IP

check_postgres_master.c

This is an example of the same check writen in C. Not really any faster and probably
very broken.
